  <h2 class="section-title">Summary</h2><p>AI tutors and copilots can transform large, lecture‑heavy courses into more coached experiences. Students receive instant hints and formative feedback while lecturers see analytics to target support. Accuracy varies, so human oversight is essential. Done well, tutors free time for higher‑order dialogue and projects, shifting classrooms from quantity to quality of understanding.</p>
  <h2 class="section-title">Factors</h2><p>Socially, students need timely feedback and explanations that match diverse prior knowledge. Economically, institutions balance licensing and scale while deciding which features provide real impact. Environmentally, digital workflows reduce printing though compute use should be monitored. Politically, public trust and policy set guardrails for acceptable use, especially in assessment contexts.</p>
  <h2 class="section-title">Implications</h2><p>At the societal level, access to formative support can build confidence and persistence. Nationally, massified systems could raise productivity if AI reduces bottlenecks in feedback. Globally, well‑designed tutors could scale to underserved learners provided access barriers are addressed.</p>
  <h2 class="section-title">Solutions</h2><p>Adopt a human‑in‑the‑loop model where lecturers monitor dashboards and step in on misconceptions. Provide low‑bandwidth and translation modes to support inclusion across languages and connectivity levels. Curate prompt libraries aligned to learning outcomes so students practise explaining, not just producing answers.</p>
  <h2 class="section-title">Connection to Lecture Topics</h2><p>Logic guides error‑checking and argument structure; Epistemology reminds us to seek justification over plausible output; the Concept of Human Being centres coaching and formation rather than mere optimisation.</p>
